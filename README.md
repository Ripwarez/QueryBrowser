# QueryBrowser

QueryBrowser is an DataTables alternative primarily aimed at CMS-systems but it can be used wherever you like. The biggest
difference is that QueryBrowser only works server-side and the integration is easier.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or greater.
- mbstring extension to be installed.
- JQuery.
- Bootstrap 3 or 4.

## Frameworks

You can integrate this package in any framework by creating the required drivers. I will be creating special
packages for the larger frameworks in the future.

## Features

- Pagination
- Ordering
- Searching
